A time series is a sequence of measurements of the same variables made over time. 
Usually the measurements are made at evenly spaced times -- for example, weekly, monthly or yearly. 
An autoregressive model is a model where a value from a time series is regressed on previous values from same time series. 

$$y_t=\alpha+\beta_1 y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$


In this regression model, the response variable from previous time period has become the predictor. 

The order of an autoregression is the number of immediately preceding values in the series that are used to predict the value at the present time. 

So, the preceding model is a first-order autoregression, written as AR(1).

If we want to predict y using two previous time periods (y_t-1, y_t-2), the model will become:

$$y_t=\alpha+\beta_1 y_{t-1}+\beta_2 y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$$


Let's refit our COVID-19 prevalence model using AR(1).


## Loading libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(brms)
library(bayesplot)
library(tidybayes)
library(modelr)
library(lubridate)
library(rstan)
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
```


## Data

COVID19 data are again from "The study on the prevalence of the coronavirus in Estonia" <https://www.ut.ee/en/research/study-prevalence-coronavirus-estonia>

```{r, out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.ut.ee/sites/default/files/www_ut/teadus/seirelaine-tulemused-muudetud-jrejest.png")
```


```{r}
(covid19 <- read_csv(here("data/covid19.csv")))
```

Let's convert wave to factor.
```{r}
(covid <- covid19 %>% 
   mutate(
     wave = as.factor(wave),
     start_day = yday(start_date),
     end_day = yday(end_date),
     study_period = end_day - start_day,
     time = end_day - min(end_day),
     prop_pos = positive / tested
   )
 )
```



```{r}
covid %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(end_date, prop_pos)) +
  labs(x = "Study wave end date", y = "Proportion of SARS-CoV-2\npositive individuals")
```

## Fitting model with AR(1) term


```{r}
get_prior(formula = positive | trials(tested) ~ ar(time, p = 1),
  data = covid,
  family = binomial())
priors <- c(
  prior("normal(0.5, 0.1)", class = "ar"),
  prior("exponential(1)", class = "sderr"),
  prior("normal(-4.2, 0.5)", class = "Intercept")
)
mod1 <- brm(
  formula = positive | trials(tested) ~ ar(time, p = 1),
  data = covid,
  family = binomial(),
  prior = priors,
  chains = 3,
  file = here("models/positive | trials(tested) ~ ar(time, p = 1)"),
  file_refit = "on_change",
  save_pars = save_pars(all = TRUE)
)
```


```{r}
summary(mod1)
```


```{r}
mod1 <- update(mod1, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99))
```

After refitting with adapt_delta=0.99, the warning has gone away:
```{r}
summary(mod1)
```


```{r}
plot(mod1)
```

We cannot use `epred_draws` etc functions to retrieve posterior samples from this type of model, because something's always broken, but we can use good old fitted function:

```{r}
fitted(mod1,
       summary = FALSE,
       nsamples = 100) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  set_names(covid$wave) %>% 
  mutate(.iter = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("\\d"), names_to = "wave") %>% 
  left_join(covid %>% select(wave, time) %>% distinct()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = value, group = .iter), alpha = 0.1, size = 1/3) +
  geom_point(data = covid, aes(y = positive)) +
  labs(y = "Number of positive cases", caption = "Points denote original data.")
```


Or using `stat_lineribbon` geom from **bayesplot**:
```{r}
fitted(mod1,
       summary = FALSE,
       nsamples = 1000) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  set_names(covid$wave) %>% 
  mutate(.iter = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("\\d"), names_to = "wave") %>% 
  left_join(covid %>% select(wave, time) %>% distinct()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_lineribbon(aes(time, value), alpha = 1/5) +
  geom_point(data = covid, aes(x = time, y = positive)) +
  labs(x = "Days from the end of wave 12 study", y = "Number of positive cases", caption = "Points denote original data.")
```





Model looks good. However, loo is absolutely not happy with the model.

```{r}
mod2 <- brm(
  formula = positive | trials(tested) ~ ar(time, p = 2),
  data = covid,
  family = binomial(),
  prior = priors,
  chains = 3,
  file = here("models/positive | trials(tested) ~ ar(time, p = 2)"),
  file_refit = "on_change",
  save_pars = save_pars(all = TRUE)
)
```


```{r}
fitted(mod2,
       summary = FALSE,
       nsamples = 1000) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  set_names(covid$wave) %>% 
  mutate(.iter = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("\\d"), names_to = "wave") %>% 
  left_join(covid %>% select(wave, time) %>% distinct()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_lineribbon(aes(time, value), alpha = 1/5) +
  geom_point(data = covid, aes(x = time, y = positive)) +
  labs(x = "Days from the end of wave 12 study", y = "Number of positive cases", caption = "Points denote original data.")
```
